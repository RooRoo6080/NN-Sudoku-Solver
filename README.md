# Neural Network Sudoku Solver using Keras

```pip install keras numpy pandas```

```python train.py```
(~ 15 mins)

```python test.py```
OR
```python custom-input-test.py```
 - for the latter, change the "empty" array to the puzzles you want to solve and the "answer" array to the solution, if you have it. otherwise, leave it unchanged (it must have 81 characters in the string)
